			<h1>Weta</h1>
			<p>Lots of people really don’t like creepy, crawly things but they can be pretty groovy. 
			Look at them up close and you'll discover where movie directors get some of their ideas
			for weird creatures!</p>

			<h2>Wetapunga: God of Ugly things</h2>
			<p>The Little Barrier Island Giant Weta or Wetapunga is the biggest Weta of them all and
			weighs up to 71 grams. That’s three times heavier than a mouse! The name Wetapunga
			means god of ugly things but hasn’t stopped rats and other predators almost wiping it
			out! It is now only found on Little Barrier Island.</p>

			<h2>Quick Facts</h2>
			<ul>
					<li> The Weta is only found in New Zealand. </li>
					<li> Weta are large by insect standards. Some of the Giant Weta are enormous and are amongst the heaviest insects in the world. </li>
					<li> The Weta is sometimes called the dinosaur of the insect world. </li>
					<li> The Weta is the most primitive than the Tuatara. The Weta has changed very little in the past 100 million years. </li> 
					<li> Weta's have their eyes on their front knees and can feel the vibrations of noise around them. </li>
					<li> You can tell a male and a female Weta apart because females have a large oviposter, which looks a bit like a stinger, which they use to lay eggs. </li>
